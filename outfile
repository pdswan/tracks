Throw in a little reverb here, add some overlapping vocal melodies there, and you have yourself a song typical of the style. The dismissal of psychedelia is usually rooted in one of two excuses, with one being the genre\342\200\231s linear composure and the other related to the supposed target audience of deadbeats and hippies. Both are horrible stereotypes, especially in response to a genre that \342\200\223 if anything \342\200\223 is more overlooked than most styles of indie-rock that occupy the mainstream today. Although it is true that there have been many desperate psychedelia artists and fans that are tripping too hard to know who is on stage, I feel that the artists that utilize elements of psychedelia while maintaining an emphasis on other genres are being underappreciated because of this ridiculous generalizations. Spacemen 3 is the first group that comes to mind for me, as they prominently infused a new style of psychedelia that was previously interpreted as unconventional and devoid of focus. They were able to create beautiful melodies with heavy distortion and pulsing percussion, an aspect that captured fans due to the unique contrasting of different stylistic methods. Implementation of synths, one-chord jam sessions, and avant-garde production and structural techniques were prevalent, and the cult following they amassed was in result to a sound that was both incomparable and inventively brilliant.</p>\n<p>Even if they are not exactly household names to casual music fans, groups like Spacemen 3 and The Jesus and Mary Chain are responsible for molding the current perception of psychedelia as a genre that is often unpredictable and inherently multifarious. Bands like Deerhunter, Wavves, and Crystal Stilts are all clearly indebted to this, as defining their music often is an inconclusive task that leads us somewhere between psychedelia, post-punk, and indie-rock. One could say that the newest group to emerge from this righteous philosophy has the potential to be the most eclectic of them all. <strong>Crocodiles</strong> have been building some buzz for the past several months, thanks to some help from a group of a comparable stylistic vein. They were propelled initially by the praise of acclaimed noise-pop duo No Age, who wrote on their site at the end of 2008 that Crocodiles\342\200\231 \342\200\234Neon Jesus\342\200\235 was one of their favorite songs of the year. A record deal with Fat Possum Records followed less than a month later, and Crocodiles soon enough found themselves caught up in an unavoidable stream of hype. That the two frontmen consist of a teacher and a butcher almost sounds like the start of a bad joke, but it is hard to blame a band at the middle-point between obscurity and renown for holding a steady job. Butchers and teachers rarely cross paths in the world of traditional occupations, but Crocodiles appears as an exhibit of one of the best songwriting partnerships of 2009.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2884\" title=\"croc2\" src=\"http://obscuresound.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/croc2.jpg\" alt=\"croc2\" width=\"375\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p>While one would have usually found Brandon Welchez substitute-teaching in a classroom or Charles Rowell baking bread in a bakery instead of on stage or in the studio, they are both currently in the midst of a national tour that demands a show nearly every night for several months. It is hard to blame the demand for Crocodiles though, as it seems that they have emerged at a perfect time when fusions of psychedelia are accessible and familiar to many listeners of indie-rock. Crocodiles&#8217; mixture of psychedelia, noise-pop, and post-punk has earned them comparisons to Spacemen 3 and the like, but there is a sense of modernistic ingenuity even on unavoidably nostalgic efforts like \342\200\234I Wanna Kill\342\200\235 and \342\200\234Here Comes the Sky.\342\200\235 It is their stylistic adeptness that carries them far on most occasions, as their display of wispy synth lines, roaring guitars, and alternating percussion show the duo\342\200\231s most glaring strength. These contrasting elements prevail as surprisingly cohesive standards thanks to Crocodiles&#8217; impressive songwriting and stylistic composure, one that achieves innovative greatness despite some enjoyably blatant influences. \342\200\234I Wanna Kill\342\200\235 plays with the buoyant reverb of \342\200\23080s indie-rock staples like Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, while the jagged \342\200\234Flash of Light\342\200\235 is highly reminiscent of the artsy yelps and spurting bass that is typical of contemporary noise-pop. Their debut album, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEC89A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001VEC89A\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Summer of Hate</em></a>, feels like one accessible time machine; the duo appears with a seamless ability to either singularly focus on one period or fuse them together to create something extraordinarily unique.</p>\n<p>The unique craftsmanship of <em>Summer of Hate</em> results in an album that values consistency in a different light than most contemporary artists. Somehow, despite the fact that nearly each and every song sounds like it originated from a different time period, each and every song flows into one another gracefully with no force at all. \342\200\234Soft Skull (In My Room)\342\200\235 touts vocal ardency with some impressive guitar work and utilization of synths, but a hazily ethereal demeanor still lurks in Welchez\342\200\231s blithe vocals and Rowell\342\200\231s light synths. As a result, the transition into the beautiful \342\200\234Here Comes the Sky\342\200\235 succeeds without a hitch. Keys take on a similar rhythmic role as the synths on \342\200\234Soft Skull (In My Room)\342\200\235, but the duo\342\200\231s psychedelic ventures are considerably more prevalent here with a single reverbed guitar and choir-like assortment of synth pads enclosing the track into thickly reverberating heights. The style reminds me more of Blur&#8217;s more psychedelic material (\342\200\2341992\342\200\235, the bulk of <em>13</em>) than psych-rock shape-shifters like Spacemen 3, but this time it results in perhaps the group\342\200\231s greatest achievement thus far. <em>Summer of Hate</em> is a distinctively memorable debut that achieves based on its own innovation, as it masterfully juggles the divide between audible influence and focused creativity.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-her.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Crocodiles - Here Comes the Sky<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-her.mp3\">Download audio file (croc-her.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-iwa.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Crocodiles - I Wanna Kill<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-iwa.mp3\">Download audio file (croc-iwa.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-sof.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Crocodiles - Soft Skull (In My Room)<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/croc-sof.mp3\">Download audio file (croc-sof.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.fatpossum.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fat Possum Records<br />\n</em></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/crocodilescrocodilescrocodiles\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MySpace</em></a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VEC89A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001VEC89A\" target=\"_blank\">BUY</a></p>",

Many of them send out hordes of e-mails and MySpace invitations to the point where it nearly seems like spam. It may seem like a nuisance to even the most passionate music fan, but what separates these artists from the pseudo-corporations is their justification in doing this; they simply want someone to listen to their music, not deposit a couple grand into a Nigerian bank account. From hanging up self-printed ads on the street to the accessibility of e-mail, advertising without straining one\342\200\231s wallet is vital to most independent musicians. Especially with this economy, most of their day-jobs just barely cover basic expenses.  And if they have the choice to use their extra income on instruments and recording or advertising, most of these artists are going to go for the former. For a band of <strong>Clues&#8217;</strong> high caliber, one would expect them to at least make an effort in self-promotion. Originating from the same Montreal experimental-pop music scene as bands like Malajube, The Dears, and Wolf Parade, Clues\342\200\231 solid songwriting and unique approach make their chances of reaching similar heights quite likely. But if they have such blatant ability, one would likely wonder why they have no MySpace page or web site. It is humorous that this era makes the absence of either one seem deviant, but there is little denying the impact of such technological tools on independent music promotion.</p>\n<p>Lack of experience is certainly not the reason for such an unconventional approach, as two of the group&#8217;s five members are from two groups that is synonymous with the Montreal music scene. In fact, one could make the argument that they are a few of the most important acts the Canadian city has had this decade. Brendan Reed was a member of Arcade Fire before they released <em>Funeral</em>, widely considered to be one of the best debut albums of the decade. Reed&#8217;s vocals and percussion work appeard on the album, and he later went on to join <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/lammtl\" target=\"_blank\">Les Angles Morts</a>. Clues&#8217; lead vocalist and other frontman, Alden Penner, co-founded of The Unicorns with Nick Thorburn in 2000 and remained with the group throughout its short but acclaimed career until late 2004, when Thorburn began his work with Islands and Penner started releasing solo material. The fusion of Reed\342\200\231s multi-instrumental ability and the type of innovative songwriting Penner brought to the table in The Unicorns has some great results on Clues\342\200\231 self-titled debut album, set to be released on May 19th through Constellation Records. Upon Clues&#8217; initial formation in 2007, Reed and Penner played small-profile gigs around Montreal. After constructing the group&#8217;s approach, the duo expanded Clues in 2008 after Ben Borden, Lisa Gamble, and Nick Scribner joined. The additional instrumentation gave them what was necessary to create their excellent debut album, which should almost certainly achieve recognition without self-promotion.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2880\" title=\"clues2\" src=\"http://obscuresound.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/clues2.jpg\" alt=\"clues2\" width=\"360\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p>Apart from their musical work on-stage and in the studio, the entrepreneurial Clues have devoted a large amount of time to <a href=\"http://VillaVillaNola.com\" target=\"_blank\">VillaVillaNola.com</a>, an online music store that features under-appreciated artists from Montreal and elsewhere. It is a clear indication of their love for the scene and the DIY ethic in general, also indicated by their non-existent promotional approach. Such tactics can prove admirable for a band of Clues\342\200\231 stature, even if an ample amount of it was likely derived from sheer confidence. Reed and Penner have had plenty of experience with a few of the greatest bands to come out of Montreal this decade, and the three other members are honed as skilled musicians with plenty of ideas. This leaves little room for acquiring experience and ample room for producing some fantastic music, resulting in a debut album that sounds like it was created by a group that has been working together for over two years. Their approach is extremely eclectic, fusing influences of art-rock, electronica, and psychedelia that results in a sound that fits in the realm of Montreal-based experimental-pop music while maintaining the utmost originality. From the swaying, sitar-like effect throughout the exotic \342\200\234In the Dream\342\200\235 to the excitable array of fuzzy guitars in \342\200\234Remember Severed Head\342\200\235, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UYTNRG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001UYTNRG\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Clues</em></a> is a debut that never seems tireless, unmotivated, or unfocused.</p>\n<p>That Clues can maintain such a stylistic focus through an array of songs that generate hooks and awe-inspiring moments through varying styles of instrumentation and unpredictable structural tendencies is part of Clues\342\200\231 charm. \342\200\234Remember Severed Head\342\200\235 is under three minutes in length, but it is so brisk that it seems like several songs in one with its apt transitions. The distorted vein of post-punk in the verses grows into an ethereal, monophonic guitar melody before the thrilling verses arrive again. Penner\342\200\231s vocals are excellent throughout, as is the instrumental works on all fronts; the guitars sparkle with intricately empowering progressions, while a flurry of keys and percussion combine to form a ceaselessly excitable backdrop. \342\200\234Perfect Fit\342\200\235 takes an entirely different route altogether, allowing an old-fashioned piano to be run under Penner\342\200\231s trembling vocals. \342\200\234I have seen the most incredible light in your eyes,\342\200\235 he repeats, allowing the melody to grow upon itself with increasing percussion and an explosion of guitars and bass that concludes the song masterfully. \342\200\234Crows\342\200\235 is also notable for its swanky mixture of guitars and horns, especially when combined with the high-pitched vocals that endure throughout. \342\200\234Let\342\200\231s Get Strong\342\200\235 is a light piano ballad that concludes <em>Clues</em>, serving as the most simplistic effort on the album. By this point though, Clues\342\200\231 ambition is no question. Every track on <em>Clues</em> is a genuinely worthwhile journey with both excellent performances and songwriting. Expect this one to be talked about quite a bit.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-rem.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Clues - Remember Severed Head<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-rem.mp3\">Download audio file (clues-rem.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-per.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Clues - Perfect Fit<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-per.mp3\">Download audio file (clues-per.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-cro.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Clues - Crows<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/clues-cro.mp3\">Download audio file (clues-cro.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cstrecords.com/releases/cst057/info\" target=\"_blank\">Constellation Records</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UYTNRG?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001UYTNRG\" target=\"_blank\">BUY</a></p>",

The ideas and talent can be there, but the necessary materials may not be. Many groups have accomplished enough without the use of a bass, guitar, or vocals, but percussion is an element that is too unique to be mimicked or replicated without the use of technology. I was just reminded of the complications involved in missing an instrumental component last week when I featured The Mint Chicks, a New Zealand-based act that had to cope with the absence of their bassist after moving overseas to Portland. They conquered this obstacle by having guitars incorporate low-pitched, bass-like notes on their tracks, and they did so in such a meticulous manner that most listeners would be unaware of the absence. The case is less common for the absence of a guitar, but there are several artists like Ben Folds, Death From Above 1979, and The Dresden Dolls that have done just fine by using a mixture of keys, bass, and percussion to create a signature sound. Percussion is where it gets tricky though, as practically everything apart from classical pieces, ambient music, and a jazz solo here and there seems to utilize percussion prominently, regardless of how complex or simplistic the accompaniment is.</p>\n<p>It has become somewhat customary for electronic artists to hone their percussive skills through technological means, even if their ability to play a real-life drum kit is limited at best. Some look upon this as a shameful practice, but I see little difference between that and hiring a drummer to put one\342\200\231s songwriting into audible form. In fact, if one is able to construct unconventionally appropriate percussive beats in the realm of electronica like Junior Boys or Kelley Polar, it often sounds better than using a typical drum set. The allure of live percussion may be taken away, but some styles and songs within them utilize technological progression better than others. If rock bands were to utilize this technological approach though, the results would likely be catastrophic due to the flexibility that the genre demands on all instrumental fronts. Apart from their sheer melodic ability, one of the most impressive things about <strong>Two Door Cinema Club</strong> is how they appear to be defying such stereotypes with their crisp interpretation of indie-rock. The Northern Irish trio have enough slick guitar progressions, subtly infectious bass lines, and amiable vocal harmonies to come across as any first-tier indie-rock group, which should make their percussive absence surprising to any listener that is treated to their flavorful sound.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2876\" title=\"tdcc2\" src=\"http://obscuresound.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/tdcc2.jpg\" alt=\"tdcc2\" width=\"330\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p>That three individuals craft such a memorable style with the aid of laptop-based percussion is impressive in itself, but the fact that their impressive songwriting and emphasis on production capitalizes on the percussive absence is what separates Two Door Cinema Club from many of their indie-rock contemporaries. In addition to being the lead vocalist, Alex Trimble is classified as the beat-maker with his percussive chops, even if his experience with drum kits is limited. Thanks to his astute ability - in addition to bassist Kevin Baird and guitarist Sam Halliday - Two Door Cinema Club end up sounding just as refreshingly infectious as groups like Phoenix, French Kicks, and The Whitest Boy Alive. Such acts exemplify a recent trend in indie-rock, which incorporates a wider embracement of electronica and dance. To be specific, Two Door Cinema Club\342\200\231s incorporation of electronic music echoes the sentiments of Phoenix\342\200\231s recent material, especially with the fast-paced and ambidextrous vocals of Trimble. Although the hazy synth washings of \342\200\234Do You Want It All?\342\200\235 suggest a capacity for balladry, Two Door Cinema Club\342\200\231s half-a-dozen or so released songs are often excitable with quick tempos and swift vocal accompaniments. This remains consistent throughout all of their songs, a steady indication that their eventual full-length debut will be something that attracts a significant amount of attention.</p>\n<p>Two Door Cinema Club&#8217;s new single, \342\200\234Something Good Can Work\342\200\235, is also indicative of their probable success As their most polished effort yet, &#8220;Something Good Can Work&#8221; was the first track I heard from Two Door Cinema Club and I was hooked after the initial listen. What may initially appear to be a fusion of Modest Mouse&#8217;s swift angst-rock sensibility and Phoenix&#8217;s undeniable ability to craft a devastating indie-rock hook takes on its own original form upon repeated listens, as the trio\342\200\231s talents evolve with each brilliant chorus. Although the guitar progressions and drum loops barely stray from their initial roots, the subtle melodic additives in the chorus alongside Trimble\342\200\231s heightened pitch makes the single both danceable and incredibly radio-friendly. Knowing that their percussive capabilities are limited, the emphasis on guitars and bass are highlighted enjoyably, resulting in multiple layers of melodically invigorating progressions that supplement one another in natural and inventive form. For \342\200\234Do You Want It All?\342\200\235, Death Cab For Cutie&#8217;s tendency to originally incorporate indie-rock and electro-pop come to mind, but the lighthearted demeanor of the track once again places it in the realm of instantaneous enjoyment that only comes so naturally for Two Door Cinema Club.</p>\n<p>\342\200\234Hands Off My Cash, Monty\342\200\235, while less impressive than the two preceding efforts, is worthy enough for the trio\342\200\231s ability to simultaneous incorporate a vast array of guitar progressions. The approach is similar to late \342\200\23090s indie-rock, particularly in relation to The Wrens and Broken Social Scene, but suffers from repetition despite a handful of satisfying ideas throughout. Considering that it is offered as a free b-side though, it is not surprising that it cannot stand up to \342\200\234Something Good Can Work.\342\200\235 For further indication of quality Two Door Cinema Club, check out the two songs on their MySpace, &#8220;Cigarettes in the Theatre&#8221; and &#8220;Undercover Martyn.\342\200\235 They both benefit from the excellent approach exhibited on \342\200\234Something Good Can Work\342\200\235, which was a devilishly good incorporation of electro-pop and indie-rock. Since Phoenix and the like are finding such success with similar styles, one can expect the fantastic songwriting of Two Door Cinema Club to carry them to great heights. Now all we have to wait on is the full-length debut, which the trio promises is in the making. At the moment, they are shooting for a release date of late 2009 or early 2010.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-som.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Two Door Cinema Club - Something Good Can Work<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-som.mp3\">Download audio file (tdcc-som.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-doy.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Two Door Cinema Club - Do You Want It All?<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-doy.mp3\">Download audio file (tdcc-doy.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-han.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Two Door Cinema Club - Hands Off My Cash, Monty<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/tdcc-han.mp3\">Download audio file (tdcc-han.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/twodoorcinemaclub\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MySpace</em></a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001YAHWLU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B001YAHWLU\" target=\"_blank\">BUY</a> (<a href=\"http://www.roughtrade.com/site/shop_detail.lasso?search_type=sku&amp;sku=309892\" target=\"_blank\">UK</a>)</p>",

The weather sucks, the workload for classes is nearing its peak, and my inability to pick a decent bracket frustrates me to no end (damn you, Memphis and Pitt). But hey, classes are over about a month from now and baseball starts next week, so things could be worse. In a month where good music was vital in improving somber moods, several artists prevailed with some excellent material. From familiar faces like The Veils and R\303\266yksopp to up-and-coming hype machines like Micachu, Tesla Boy, and Julian Velard, several artists made March a month to remember with a handful of releases that are sure to appear on my year-end list. The &#8217;80s electro of Tesla Boy and the cabaret-pop of Julian Velard suggest some sort of throwback theme, but wildly successful attempts at innovation from Micachu, The Veils, and others make it a compilation that presents material derived from both nostalgia and contemporary innovation.

There is little reason for them to pay much attention to the Top 40, since worthwhile artists do not derive their material from popular opinion. It may seem like a bold statement, but there is little purpose in devoting a large amount of time to a songwriter who sounds like everyone else on the radio. Listeners come to expect innovation but there is often a personal struggle for artists that wish to find the middle ground between accustomed accessibility and staggering innovation. This process often cannot be resolved through practice though, as the proper ideology appears to be embedded within the talented scope of an artist whether it is before they start writing songs or not. If one has a tendency to gravitate toward the unconventional in the early stages of their life, it can provide good indication of such an embedded ideology. When <strong>Julian Velard</strong> was in his teens and started to become wildly interested in music, one can imagine the social circumstances that surrounded him. Unlike today\342\200\231s auto-tuned R&amp;B and subliminally linear pop music, the 29-year-old experienced the likes of Pavement, Nirvana, and the Pixies when music began to first tickle his ears. He enjoyed the emerging genres of grunge and indie-rock but, unlike his peers, much of Velard\342\200\231s attention was diverted elsewhere: cabaret-style pop music.</p>\n<p>While Velard&#8217;s similar adoration for stylistically contrasting groups like XTC, Hall &amp; Oates, and Rage Against the Machine is indicative of his eclectic persona, his favoritism for piano-based cabaret pop in the vein of Elton John and Randy Newman shows most prominently in his music.  However, Velard is not guilty of exploiting the past, as he allows his steady influences to be effected by components of contemporary pop music in order to ease the transition for his modernistic audience. Similarly to Rufus Wainwright, Velard\342\200\231s demanding presence as a performer, vocalist, and songwriter is a simultaneous force that appears both on record and on stage. Hearkening back to the days of cabaret, he is a multi-instrumental whiz who uses his highly melodic vocals, engaging storytelling ability, and key-based instrumentation to construct a wide arsenal of uplifting pop hooks and melancholic ballads. In Velard\342\200\231s case, this force is also inherent behind his webcam. Success has never been immediate for the NYC-based songwriter, but his practice of recording cover songs by the likes of Madonna, Michael Jackson, and Kings of Leon has provided him with nearly one million views on YouTube, being very symbolic of Velard\342\200\231s method of obtaining success thus far. Although he has yet to attain substantial recognition in the US, Velard\342\200\231s online fanbase continues to grow both domestically and internationally due to his personable online presence.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2869\" title=\"velard2\" src=\"http://obscuresound.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/velard2.jpg\" alt=\"velard2\" width=\"361\" height=\"240\" /></p>\n<p>It was through Velard\342\200\231s digitalized awareness that he has become a very recognizable name in the UK. One of the many spectators of Velard\342\200\231s covers on YouTube and his online cult following were a few British music executives that eventually landed Velard a deal with EMI in 2007. Detecting that the British audience would be more receptive to his style of cabaret-pop, Velard moved to the UK and began writing material for his new album, <em>The Planeteer</em>. Prior to this, Velard had self-released three albums that were well-polished but went mainly overlooked. In the UK, however, the opposite was true. There are just certain groups (The Jam come to mind) who find momentous success in the UK and not in the US, and Velard\342\200\231s case is fascinating since the US is actually his country of origin. Even so, it perplexes me as to how no American labels took notice of Velard before EMI picked him up. His style is distinctively accessible, enough so that his twinkling keys and impressive vocals craft hooks that are instantly prevalent and very radio-friendly. If I were to guess though, <em>The Planeteer</em> should be explosive for Velard\342\200\231s stateside recognition. Apart from being his first release on a major label, it finds his excellent pop songwriting chops refined by sharper production, an increase in confidence, and less pressure due to his previous accomplishments (signing with EMI, touring with the likes of Goldfrapp and Ben Kweller, etc.). If both EMI and Velard accomplish what they have the potential to, <em>The Planeteer</em> could be one of the most prominent breakthrough albums of 2009.</p>\n<p>Now that Velard has finally been given the opportunity to widely distribute his material, it is hardly a surprise that a few fan favorites are re-appearing on <em>The Planeteer</em>. Both &#8220;Jimmy Dean &amp; Steve McQueen&#8221; and &#8220;Joni&#8221; appeared on 2006&#8217;s <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010VFRVU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=B0010VFRVU\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Movies Without You</em></a>, but they are certainly memorable enough to warrant placement on his first major release. \342\200\234Jimmy Dean &amp; Steve McQueen\342\200\235 is an irresistible ode to Velard\342\200\231s appreciation of film and the idolized actors in them. Whether he sings of plastic surgery or unrealistic nostalgia, the loss of innocence relayed in \342\200\234Jimmy Dean &amp; Steve McQueen\342\200\235 is the perfect example of Velard\342\200\231s delivery with its entertaining lyrical quips and assortment of saxophones, guitars, and keyboards. \342\200\234Joni\342\200\235 is another particularly engaging pop song, being somewhat reminiscent to Ted Leo\342\200\231s \342\200\234Timorous Me\342\200\235 in its reflectively romanticized approach. The chorus here is marvelous, using an effective assortment of sparkling keys and swift strings to construct what has the potential to be Velard\342\200\231s first stateside \342\200\234hit.\342\200\235 Velard\342\200\231s lyrical content is never particularly complex or thought-provoking, but his words are fun and his infectious melodies supplement them beautifully. As seen on any of these tracks, Velard has an astute ability to judge a pop song. His songs never stray too long or end too abruptly; they are always filled with enough melodic alterations to hook the listener from start to finish. It is a rare skill among modern songwriters and producers alike, and it is likely one that will finally carry Velard to success on a national level.</p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-jim.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Julian Velard - Jimmy Dean &amp; Steve McQueen<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-jim.mp3\">Download audio file (velard-jim.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-jon.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Julian Velard - Joni<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-jon.mp3\">Download audio file (velard-jon.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-lov.mp3\" target=\"_self\">Julian Velard - Love Again for the First Time<br />\n</a></span></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://mineorecords.com/mp3/velard-lov.mp3\">Download audio file (velard-lov.mp3)</a></p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.julianvelard.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Official Web Site</em></a> (this site won awards for a good reason &#8212; check it out)<a href=\"http://www.julianvelard.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em><br />\n</em></a></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/julianvelard\" target=\"_blank\"><em>MySpace</em></a></em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=julian%20velard&amp;tag=obscuresound-20&amp;index=digital-music&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325\" target=\"_blank\">BUY</a></p>",
